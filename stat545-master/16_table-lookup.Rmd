# Table lookup {#lookup}

I try to use [dplyr joins](#join-cheatsheet) for most tasks that combine data from two tibbles. But sometimes you just need good old "table lookup". Party like it's Microsoft Excel `LOOKUP()` time!

## Load gapminder and the tidyverse

```{r start_lookup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Create mini Gapminder

Work with a tiny subset of Gapminder, `mini_gap`.

```{r}
mini_gap <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Belgium", "Canada", "United States", "Mexico"),
         year > 2000) %>% 
  select(-pop, -gdpPercap) %>% 
  droplevels()
mini_gap
```

## Dorky national food example.

Make a lookup table of national foods. Or at least the stereotype. Yes, I have intentionally kept Mexico in mini-Gapminder and neglected to put Mexico here.

```{r}
food <- tribble(
        ~ country,    ~ food,
        "Belgium",  "waffle",
         "Canada", "poutine",
  "United States", "Twinkie"
)
food
```

## Lookup national food

`match(x, table)` reports where the values in the key `x` appear in the lookup variable `table`. It returns positive integers for use as indices. It assumes `x` and `table` are free-range vectors, i.e. there's no implicit data frame on the radar here.

Gapminder's `country` plays the role of the key `x`. It is replicated, i.e. non-unique, in `mini_gap`, but not in `food`, i.e. no country appears more than once `food$country`. FYI `match()` actually allows for multiple matches by only consulting the first.

```{r}
match(x = mini_gap$country, table = food$country)
```

In table lookup, there is always a value variable `y` that you plan to index with the `match(x, table)` result.  It often lives together with `table` in a data frame; they should certainly be the same length and synced up with respect to row order.

But first...

I get `x` and `table` backwards some non-negligible percentage of the time. So I store the match indices and index the data frame where `table` lives with it. Add `x` as a column and eyeball-o-metrically assess that all is well.

```{r}
(indices <- match(x = mini_gap$country, table = food$country))
add_column(food[indices, ], x = mini_gap$country)
```

Once all looks good, do the actual table lookup and, possibly, add the new info to your main table.

```{r}
mini_gap %>% 
  mutate(food = food$food[indices])
```

Of course, if this was really our exact task, we could have used a join!

```{r}
mini_gap %>% 
  left_join(food)
```

But sometimes you have a substantive reason (or psychological hangup) that makes you prefer the table look up interface.

## World's laziest table lookup

While I'm here, let's demo another standard R trick that's based on indexing by name.

Imagine the table you want to consult isn't even a tibble but is, instead, a named character vector.

```{r}
(food_vec <- setNames(food$food, food$country))
```

Another way to get the national foods for mini-Gapminder is to simply index `food_vec` with `mini_gap$country`.

```{r}
mini_gap %>% 
  mutate(food = food_vec[country])
```

HOLD ON. STOP. Twinkies aren't the national food of Mexico!?! What went wrong?

Remember `mini_gap$country` is a factor. So when we use it in an indexing context, it's integer nature is expressed. It is pure luck that we get the right foods for Belgium and Canada. Luckily the Mexico - United States situation tipped us off. Here's what we are really indexing `food_vec` by above:

```{r}
unclass(mini_gap$country)
```

To get our desired result, we need to explicitly coerce `mini_gap$country` to character.

```{r end_lookup}
mini_gap %>% 
  mutate(food = food_vec[as.character(country)])
```

When your key variable is character (and not a factor), you can skip this step.
