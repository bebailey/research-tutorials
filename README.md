*	Project management (naming conventions for files and folders courtesy of [Jenny Bryan](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf), folder organization, time management things, some system of communication probably via Github issues) also [Zen and the Art of Workflow Maintenance](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/zen-and-the-art-of-workflow-maintenance) and [what they forgot to teach you about R](https://rstats.wtf)

*	Using [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/) for managing citations and generating a .bib file
*	Using APA format for citations, perhaps going through this [APA Quick Guide](https://extras.apa.org/apastyle/citing-in-text/?_ga=2.54587171.908000727.1588626320-1605473764.1588626320#/) on in-text citations (and possibly this [plagiarism training program](https://plagiarism.iu.edu/index.html) from Indiana University, I think again based on APA)
*	Creating an annotated bibliography as part of the literature review process (pulling from [Raul Pacheco-Vega](http://www.raulpacheco.org/resources/literature-reviews/) on those, probably)
*	How to conduct a simulation study (using [Morris et al’s 2019 paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.8086), probably)
*	Debugging code (again, courtesy of [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc/debugging) )
*	Effective figures and tables (I plan to create something similar to [Karl Broman’s slides](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs2018.pdf) for the incubator)
*	Style and grammar tips (courtesy of [Rod Little](https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=dW1pY2guZWR1fHJvZC1saXR0bGV8Z3g6MmQzZjVhM2VjOWVlN2Q0Mw))
*	Working with the thesis template (if the guide and updated template are not self-sufficient)
*	Maybe some things from this [Writing Science](http://ezproxy.amherst.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=422162&site=eds-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_26) book
